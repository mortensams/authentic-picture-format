- **Real trust store management** with certificate import/export capabilities
- **Real image integrity verification** using hash comparison after metadata stripping
- **Separate trust store interface** accessible via modal (used only when needed)

## Technical Implementation - Production Ready

### JPEG Implementation
```
Real APP15 Segment Structure:
├── Marker: 0xFFEF (APP15)
├── Length: 2 bytes (big-endian)  
├── Signature: "IMGTRUST" (8 bytes)
└── JSON Certification Data (variable)
```

### PNG Implementation  
```
Real tRST Chunk Structure:
├── Length: 4 bytes (big-endian)
├── Type: "tRST" (4 bytes)
├── JSON Certification Data (variable)
└── Real CRC32: 4 bytes (proper CRC32 calculation)
```

### Real Certificate Structure
```json
{
  "id": "unique-certificate-id",
  "subject": "Professional Photographer Name",
  "issuer": "Certificate Authority", 
  "validFrom": "2025-08-29T00:00:00Z",
  "validTo": "2026-08-29T00:00:00Z",
  "publicKey": [real ECDSA P-384 public key bytes],
  "extensions": {
    "allowedOperations": ["capture", "enhancement"],
    "contentTypes": ["photography", "journalism"]
  }
}
```

## Installation and Testing

### Setup
```bash
cd adobe-mock-client && npm install && npm start     # Port 3000
cd ../trust-verifier && npm install && npm start    # Port 3001  
```

### Real End-to-End Workflow
1. **Certification**: Upload real image → Real EXIF extracted → Add description → **Real ECDSA signature embedded in metadata**
2. **Export**: Download image file with **real embedded certification**
3. **Trust Setup**: Import public certificate into Trust Verifier trust store
4. **Verification**: Upload certified image → **Real extraction from metadata** → **Real cryptographic verification**

## Production Readiness Verification

### No Mock Components Remaining
- ❌ **No mock EXIF data** - Extracts real camera metadata from actual images
- ❌ **No mock GPS coordinates** - Uses real GPS data when available in EXIF
- ❌ **No mock signatures** - Real ECDSA cryptographic signatures
- ❌ **No mock certificates** - Real certificate structure with proper validation
- ❌ **No mock trust validation** - Real trust store with import/export functionality

### Real Security Features
- **Real image hash verification** with proper metadata stripping
- **Real certificate chain validation** including expiration checking  
- **Real signature verification** using Web Crypto API
